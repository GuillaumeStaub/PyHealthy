Why this program? 
-----------------                                                                    
This Terminal-based application that queries the OpenFoodFacts API ([OpenFoodFacts](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org)) for recovering food and proposing a healthier alternative. So if you want to find a substitute for your favorite spread you just have to fill it out and it is all about it, it will send you a healthier spread, a description and a place to buy it.    
To recover the data we use the OFF API in the format json and we use the requests module of python to query the API. The database management system is **MySQL** and of course the language used is **Python**. A future graphical interface will be created with **PySide 2**. To create this application the skills mobilized are:                                                                      
                                                                   
* Select the appropriate programming languages for the development of the application **(Python is the best)**
                                 
* Work with an Agile project methodology (We use **Trello** to manage the project)
          
* Implement the data schema in the database                                        
* Use an algorithm to solve a technical need                                       
* Respect good development practices in force                            

***Here we will describe as each feature of the project. We will also reserve a folder with the UML diagram and the physical model of the database.***
